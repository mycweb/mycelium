// package myccanon contains canonical implementations of common patterns in Mycelium.
//
// For example, integers and floating point numbers are implemented as Arrays and
// Products of Arrays of Bits.
// There are a few ways to achieve the same bit patterns, and so defining a
// canonical method, here officially, helps create a target for acceleration
// and improve interoperability.
