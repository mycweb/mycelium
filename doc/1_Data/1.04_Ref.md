# References

A Ref is a reference to data.
*Refs* have a fixed size, which is a system parameter `RefSize`.

*Refs* are the result of *posting* to the *Store*.
A Ref is a cryptographic hash of whatever *Value* was posted to the *Store*.

While there is flexibility in how Mycelium implementations represent Values in memory, each implementation must serialize Values in exactly the same way, so that the *Refs* turn out to be the same.
A small difference in input to a cryptographic hash function will cause about 50% of the bits to be different in the output.

## Encoding
Refs takes up `RefSize` bits, which is `256` for the reference implementation.
