# Fractals

Fractal types are how [recursive types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type) are modeled in Mycelium.   They are defined in terms of at least 1 reference to itself.

A self reference is only allowed inside Lists and Refs inside Sums, otherwise the value would be infinitely large.

Fractals are stored as an [AnyProg](./1.13_AnyProg.md) with only self references.
