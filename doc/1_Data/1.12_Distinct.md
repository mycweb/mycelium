# Distinct Types

DistinctTypes are used to simulate nominal types, which are useful for ensuring the correctness of programs.
A DistinctType is created from a `base` type and a `mark` value.

Distinct types still exist within the Mycelium type system, which is a structurally typed system; therefore DistinctTypes with the same base and the same mark are the same type.

## Encoding
Values of a Distinct type are encoded exactly the same as values of the base type.
