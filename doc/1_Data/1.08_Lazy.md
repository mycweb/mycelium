# Lazy

Lazy Values contain a program which needs no runtime parameters, and is ready to be executed.
Lazy Values are encoded as a *Product* of a *Reference* and a *Size*, so they take up `RefSize + SizeBits` bits when encoded.

Evaluating a Lazy produces the result of the expression, but also caches the result so that it will not need to be computed again.
