# Lazy

Lazy values contain a program which needs no runtime parameters, and is ready to be executed.

Evaluating a Lazy produces the result of the expression, but also caches the result so that it will not need to be computed again.

## Encoding
Lazy Values are encoded as a `Product[Ref[Prog[_]], Size]]`.

This is the same as for the computational types: `Lazy`, `Lambda`, `Expr`, and `Fractal`.
