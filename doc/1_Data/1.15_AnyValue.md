# AnyValue

AnyValue can hold any *Value*, meaning all possible Mycelium Values.
The runtime type of the contained value can be checked against known types and converted to a known type.

## Encoding
AnyValue is encoded as an AnyType followed by a Ref.

```
|    AnyType   |    Ref    |
```

The Ref element type is stored in the AnyType.
