# Ports

Ports represent access to the environment.
Ports provide the capability to read and write data from outside the Mycelium VM.

## Encoding
Ports must take up `PortSize` (`256` in the reference implementation) bits of space when encoded, but what those bits are is totally unspecified.
MVM implementations can use these bits however they want.
