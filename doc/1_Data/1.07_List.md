# Lists

Lists are collections of elements, all of the same type, where the length of the List is part of the List Value of instead of the Type.

> Contrast this to *Arrays* where the length is part of the Type instead of the Value.


## Encoding
Lists are encoded as a *Product* of a `Ref[Array[T, _]]` and an `Array[Bit, SizeBits]` where `SizeBits` is a [system parameter](../70_System.md) (`32` in the reference implementation).
Phrased another way: a pointer to an array, and the number of entries in that array stuck together.

The Ref must point to an *Array* with the same element type as the List, and the length value must be the length of the Array.

When retrieving the underlying Array, if it does match the expected length, then a decoding error must occur.
