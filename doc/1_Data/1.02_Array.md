# Arrays

*Arrays* are ordered collections of Values, where each Value has the same Type.
An *ArrayType* defines the Type of elements in the Array and the length of the Array.

*Types* of type *Arrays* are *Types* with 2 parameters.
The element type `T` and the length `l`.

All Arrays where `l = 0` are encoded as 0 bits.
