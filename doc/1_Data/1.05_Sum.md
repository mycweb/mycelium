# Sums

Sum Types hold 1 value, which can be 1 of the Sum's field Types

## Encoding
Sums are encoded as a product of `content` and `tag`.
```
|     content     |  tag  |
```

`content` has as many bits as the biggest field.
When the sum has a smaller value, the remaining bits in content *must* be 0.
Tag has as many bits as the base 2 logirithm of the number of fields in the Sum.

```
|     content     |  tag  |
| field 0  |0000000       |
| field 1      |000       |
| field 2         |       |
| field 3   |000000       |
```

The `tag` bits represent the index of the set field.
The `tag` bits are appended after the `content` bits.
