# Lambda

Lambdas define a computation which requires an additional parameter.  A Lambda can only need one parameter, when it is created, if the expression used to create it needs more than 1 parameter, then the Lambda is invalid.

The MVM `apply` operation provides a parameter to a Lambda and performs the computation that the Lambda has parameterized.

## Encoding
Lambdas are encoded the same as Lazys; they take up `SizeBits + RefSize` bits.
