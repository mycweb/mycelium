# Kind

*Kinds* are the type of a type.  You can think of them as *Type2s*, if that's easier.  There are no *Type3s* in Mycelium.

There are only a few Kinds, here is the complete list.

0. [*Kind*](./1.00_Kind.md)
1. [*Bit*](./1.01_Bit.md)
2. [*Array*](./1.02_Array.md)
3. [*Program*](./1.03_Program.md)
4. [*Reference*](./1.04_Ref.md)
5. [*Sum*](./1.05_Sum.md)
6. [*Product*](./1.06_Product.md)
7. [*List*](./1.07_List.md)
8. [*Lazy*](./1.08_Lazy.md)
9. [*Lambda*](./1.09_Lambda.md)
10. [*Fractal*](./1.10_Fractal.md)
11. [*Port*](./1.11_Port.md)
12. [*Distinct*](./1.12_Distinct.md)
13. [*Expr*](./1.13_Expr.md)
14. [*AnyType*](./1.13_AnyType.md)
15. [*AnyValue*](./1.14_AnyValue.md)

## Encoding
Kinds are encoded in 32 bits.

The first 4 bits are a tag for which Kind it is, and the remaining 24 bits are the length for Product and Sum types.
For kinds other than Product and Sum, the remaining 24 bits must be zero or the encoding is invalid.

The Kind with bit pattern `00_00_00_00` (32 0s) is the fixed point for `TypeOf`. i.e. `TypeOf(TypeOf(TypeOf(.... TypeOf(x))))` is the Kind with that bit pattern.
