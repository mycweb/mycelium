# AnyProg

If *Progs* are like *Arrays* then *AnyProgs* are like *Lists*.

AnyProg are inert computational objects.
There is no MVM operation to perform computation using them directly.
Their only use is to create Lambdas and Lazy.

## Encoding
Expressions are encoded as a Ref and a Size.
The size is the length of the program.

```
|     Ref    | Size |
```
