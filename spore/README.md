# Spore

Spore is a programming language targetting the MVM.
Spore is not privelleged in any way; there is nothing it can do that another language developed outside this repository could not do.
It is intended to be an assembly language for Mycelium Values, meaning that humans can easily specify values (including expressions and lambdas). 

Spore's syntax is inspired by LISP and you may recognize its parenthesis.
